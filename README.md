# My vim configuration

## To install

you just need to clone this, into the `~/.vim` directory with;

```sh
$ cp ~/.vim ~/.vim.old ## do this if you want to preserve, and maybe recover your old configuration in the future
$ git clone https://github.com/fractal/.vim ~/.vim
$ ./install.sh
```

all the `install.sh` it does is it copies the `.vimrc`, and in the current directory
it keeps the old vimrc in `./.vimrc.old`.
